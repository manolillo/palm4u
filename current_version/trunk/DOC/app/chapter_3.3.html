runs</h3>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">A job started by <b>mrun</b>
will
- according to its requested computing time, its memory size
requirement and
the number of necessary processing elements (on parallel computers) -
be queued by the queuing-system of the remote computer into a suitable
job
class which fulfills these requirements. Each job class permits only
jobs with certain maximum requirements (e.g.
the job class <tt><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">cdev</font></tt>
on the IBM Regatta "hanni" of the HLRN permits only jobs with no more
than 7200 seconds required computing time and with using no more than
32
processing elements). The job classes are important for the scheduling
process of&nbsp; the computer. Jobs with small requirements usually
come to execution
very fast, jobs with higher requirements must wait longer (sometimes
several days). </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">Before the start of a model
run the user
must estimate how much CPU time the model will need for the simulation.
The necessary time in seconds has to be indicated with the mrun
<b>option</b> <tt><a href="http://www.muk.uni-hannover.de/institut/software/mrun_beschreibung.html#Opt-t">-t</a></tt>
and has an influence on the job class into which the job is queued. Due
to the fact that the model usually uses a variable
time step and thus the number of time steps to be executed and
consequently the time needed by the model is not
known at the beginning, this can be measured only very roughly in
many cases. So it may happen that the model needs more time than
indicated for the option <tt><u><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">-t</font></u>,</tt>
which normally leads to an abort of the job as soon as the available
CPU time is consumed. In principle one could solve this problem by
setting a very generously estimated value for <u><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">-t</font></font></u>,
but this will possibly lead to the disadvantage that the queued job has
to wait longer for execution.<br>
</p><p style="line-height: 100%;">To avoid this
problem <b>mrun </b>offers
the possibility of so-called <b>restart runs</b>. During
the model
run PALM continuously examines how much time is left for the
execution of the job. If the run is not completed and finished shortly
before
expiration of this time, the model stops and writes down the values
of (nearly) all model variables in binary form to a file (local name
<a href="chapter_3.4.html#BINOUT">BINOUT</a>).
After copying the output files required by the user, <b>mrun</b>
automatically starts a restart run. For this purpose a new <b>mrun</b>
call is set off automatically on the local computer of the user; <b>mrun</b>
thus calls itself. The options with this call correspond to a large
extent to those which the user had selected with his initial call of <b>mrun</b>.
The model restarts and this time at the beginning it reads in the
binary data written before and continues the run with them. If in
this job the CPU time is not sufficient either, in order to terminate
the run, at the end of the job another restart run is started, etc.,
until the time which shall be simulated by the model, is reached.
Thus a set of restart runs can develop - a so-called job chain. The
first run of this chain (model start at t=0) is called
<b>initial run</b>. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">Working with restart runs
and their
generation through <b>mrun</b> requires certain entries in
the
mrun-configuration file and in the parameter file, which are
described and explained in the following. The configuration file must
contain the following entries (example for the IBM Regatta of the
HLRN): </p>
<ul> <pre style="line-height: 100%;"><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">%write_binary true restart</font><br><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">#</font><br><a href="chapter_3.4.html#PARIN"><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">PARIN</font></a><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"> in:job:npe d3# ~/palm/current_version/JOBS/$fname/INPUT _p3d</font><br><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">PARIN in:job:npe d3f ~/palm/current_version/JOBS/$fname/INPUT _p3df</font><br><a href="chapter_3.4.html#BININ"><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">BININ</font></a><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"> in:loc d3f ~/palm/current_version/JOBS/$fname/OUTPUT _d3d</font><br><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">#</font><br><a href="chapter_3.4.html#BINOUT"><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">BINOUT</font></a><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"> out:loc restart ~/palm/current_version/JOBS/$fname/OUTPUT _d3d</font></pre></ul>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">The <b>mrun</b>
call for the
initialization run of the job chain must look as follows: </p>
<ul> <pre style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm; line-height: 100%;"><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">mrun -h ibmh -d abcde -t 900 -r "d3# restart"</font></pre></ul>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">The specification of the
environment
variable <tt><tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">writ</font></tt></tt><tt><tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">e_binary</font><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">, </font></tt></tt>which
must be
assigned the value <tt><tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">true</font></tt></tt>,
is essential. Only in this case the model writes
binary-coded data for a possible restart run to the local file <tt><tt><a href="chapter_3.4.html#BINOUT">BINOUT</a></tt></tt>
at the end of the run. Then of course this output file must be stored
on a permanent file with an appropriate file connection statement
(last line of the example above). As you can see, both instructions
(variable declaration and connection statements) are only carried out
by <b>mrun</b>, if the character string <tt><tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">restart</font></tt></tt>
is given for the option <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">-r</font>
</tt>in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">mrun</span>
call. Thus
the example above can also be used
if no restart runs are intended. In such cases the character string
<tt><tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">restart</font></tt></tt>
with the option <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">-r</font></tt>
can simply be omitted. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">Only by the specification of
<tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">write_binary=true</font><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">
</font><font face="Thorndale, serif">the</font></tt>
model is
instructed to compute the remaining CPU time after each time step and
stop, if the run is not going to be completed and finished briefly
before expiration of
this time. Actually the stop takes place when the
difference from the available job time (determined by the <b>mrun</b>
option <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">-t</font></tt>)
and
the time used so far by the job becomes smaller than the time given
by the model variable <a href="chapter_4.2.html#termination_time_needed">termination_time_needed</a>.
With the variable <b>termination_time_needed </b>the user
determines,
how much time is needed for binary copying of the data for restart
runs, as
well as for the following data archiving and transfer of result data
etc. (as long as this is part of the job). Thus, as soon as the
remaining job time is less than <b>termination_time_needed</b>,
the
model stops
the time step procedure and copies the data for a restart run to the
local binary file BINOUT. The so-called initialization parameters are
also written to this file (see <a href="chapter_4.0.html">chapter
4.0</a>). In a last step the model produces another file with the
local name CONTINUE_RUN. The presence of this file signals <b>mrun</b>
the fact that a restart run must be started and leads to the
start of an appropriate job. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;"><font color="#000000">During
the initial
phase of a restart ru</font>n different actions than during the
initial
phase of an initial run of the model are neccessary. In this
case the model must read in the binary data written by the preceding
run at the beginning of the run. Beyond that it also reads the
initialization parameters from this file. Therefore these do not need
to be indicated in the parameter file (local name <a href="chapter_3.4.html#PARIN">PARIN</a>).
If they are indicated nevertheless and if their value deviates from
their value of the initial run, then this is ignored. There is
exactly one exception to this rule: with the help of the
initialization parameter <a href="chapter_4.1.html#initializing_actions">initializing_actions</a>
it is determined whether the job is a restart run or an
initial run. If <b>initializing_actions</b> =
&ldquo;<i>read_restart_data&rdquo;</i>, then it is
a restart
run, otherwise an initial run. The previous remarks make it
clear that the model obviously needs two different parameter files
(local name PARIN) for the case of job chains. One is needed for the
initial run and contains all initialization parameters set by
the user and the other one is needed for restart runs. The
last one only contains the initialization parameter
<b>initializing_actions</b> (also, initialization
parameters with values different from the initial run may appear in
this file, but they will be ignored), which
must have the value &ldquo;<i>read_restart_data&rdquo;</i>.
Therefore the user must produce two different parameter files if he
wants to operate job chains. Since the model always expects the
parameter file on the local file <tt>PARIN</tt>, two
different file
connection statements must be given for this file in the
configuration file. One may be active only at the initial run,
the other one only at restart runs. The <b>mrun </b>call
for the
initial run shown above activates the first of the two
specified connection statements, because the character string <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">d3#</font></tt>
with the option <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">-r</font></tt>
coincides with the character
string in the third column of the connection statement. Obviously
the next statement must be active</p>
<ul> <pre style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm; line-height: 100%;"><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">PARIN in:job:npe d3f ~/palm/current_version/JOBS/$fname/INPUT _p3df</font></pre></ul>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">with the restart runs. Given
that t<font color="#000000">his statement only gets</font>
active if the option <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">-r</font></tt> is given the value
<tt><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">d3f</font></tt>
and that
the <b>mrun</b> call for this restart run is produced
automatically (thus not by the user), <b>mrun</b>
obviously has to
replace <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">"d3#"</font></tt>
of the initial run with <tt><tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">"d3f"</font>
</tt></tt>within the call of this restart run. Actually,
with restart
runs all <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">"#"</font></tt>
characters within the strings given for the options <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">-r</font></font></tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">
, </font></font><tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">-i</font></font></tt>
and <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">-o</font></tt>
are
replaced by <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">&ldquo;f&rdquo;</font></tt>.
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">For example, for the initial
run
the permanent file </p>
<ul> <pre style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm; line-height: 100%;">~/palm/current_version/JOBS/abcde/INPUT/abcde_p3d</pre></ul>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">and for restart runs the
permanent file<span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span></p>
<ul style="font-family: monospace;"> <pre style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm; line-height: 100%;"><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">~/palm/current_version/JOBS/abcde/INPUT/abcde_p3df</font></pre></ul>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">is used. Only with restart
runs the
local file <tt>BININ</tt> is made available as input file,
because
the appropriate file connection statement also contains the
character string <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">"d3f"</font></tt>
in the third column. This is logical and necessary since in BININ the
binary data, produced by the model of the preceding job of the chain,
are expected and the initial run does not need these
data The permanent names of this input file (local name BININ) and
the corresponding output file (local name BINOUT) are identical and
read </p>
<ul> <pre style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm; line-height: 100%;"><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">~/palm/current_version/JOBS/abcde/OUTPUT/abcde_d3d.</font></pre></ul>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">However, after the file
produced by the
previous job was read in by the model and after at the local file
<tt>BINOUT </tt>was produced at the end of the job, the
restart job does not overwrite this permanent file (<tt>&hellip;/<font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">abcde_d3d</font></tt>)
with the new data. Instead of that, it is examined whether already
a permanent file with the name <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">&hellip;/abcde_d3d</font>
<font face="Thorndale, serif">exists </font></tt>when
copying the
output file (<tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">BINOUT</font></tt>)
of <b>mrun</b>. If this is the case, <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">BINOUT</font></tt>
is copied to the file<font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">
</font></font><tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">&hellip;/abcde_d3d.1</font></font></tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">.</font></font>
Even if this file is already present, <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">&hellip;/abcde_d3d.2</font></tt>
is tried etc. For an input file the highest existing cycle
of the respective permanent file is copied. In the example above this
means: the initial run creates the permanent file
<tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">&hellip;/abcde_d3d</font></tt><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">,</font>
the first restart run uses this file and creates <tt>&hellip;/<font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">abcde_d3d.1</font></tt>,
the second restart run creates <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">&hellip;/abcde_d3d.2</font></tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">
</font>etc. After completion of the job chain the user can still
access all files created by the jobs. This makes it possible for the
user for example to restart the model run of a certain job of the job
chain again. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">Therefore restart jobs can
not only be
started automatically through <b>mrun</b>, but also
manually by the
user. This is necessary e.g. whenever after the end of a job chain
it is decided that the simulation must be continued further, because
the phenomenon which should be examined did not reach the desired
state yet. In such cases the <b>mrun</b> options
completely
correspond to those of the initial call; simply the <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">"#"</font></tt>
characters in the
arguments of options <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">-r</font></font></tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">,
</font></font><tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2"><font face="Cumberland, monospace">-i</font></font></tt>
and <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">-o</font></tt>
must be
replaced by <tt><font style="font-size: 10pt;" size="2">"f"</font></tt>.
