<p style="line-height: 100%;">The start of model runs in
principle
takes place via executing the shell script <a href="http://www.muk.uni-hannover.de/%7Eraasch/Software/mrun_beschreibung.html">mrun.</a>
With this script it is possible to operate the model both
interactively and in batch mode. Batch operation is possible on the
local computer as well as on a remote computer (supposed that a batch
queuing system is available). Here only the batch operation on a remote
computer is
described, because this represents the usual mode of operation due to
the large computing time requirements of the model. The interactive
execution differs only in some points and is described in <a href="chapter_3.6.html">chapter
3.6</a>. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">By the call of <b>mrun
</b>a complete
batch job is produced, transferred to the user determined remote
computer
and submitted to its queuing system (LoadLeveler, PBS, etc.).
After processing of the job, the so-called job protocol is sent back
to the local computer of the user (the local computer is the
computer, on which the user calls <b>mrun</b>). The
following actions
are implemented by the job, amongst other: </p>
<ul> <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;">Change to a
temporary working directory. </p> </li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;">The input
files
needed by the model are copied into this directory. These files are
transferred from the local computer. </p> </li> <li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;">Execute
the
model. </p> </li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;">Copy the
output
files produced by the model into the directories determined by the user
(these are also allowed to lie on the local computer). Depending on the
choice of the user, the files may also be saved on an archiving system
(if existing). </p> </li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;">Delete the
temporary working direction. </p> </li> <li> <p style="line-height: 100%;">Transfer the job protocol to the
local computer. </p> </li>
</ul><p style="line-height: 100%;">From this list it
becomes clear that two
of the substantial functions of <b>mrun</b> are the supply
of input
files for the model and the storage of output files produced by the
model. The model exclusively works with so-called local files, which
lie in the temporary working directory created by <b>mrun.</b>
The
“local” names of these files are determined by the
model
(in the appropriate OPEN instructions). In <a href="chapter_3.4.html">chapter
3.4</a> all possible input and output filenames are specified. In
contrast to this, the input files, made available by the user,
usually lie in permanent directories (e.g. in the /home directory) and
the output data, produced by the model, may also be
stored there. The directory names are arbitrary. The actual file name
(without path) of these input and output files is specified by an
option of <b>mrun</b>. All input and output files of the
model
receive this file name (e.g. <i>abcde</i>), but each
individual file
is still provided with an extension (e.g. <i>abcde_par</i>,
etc.
<i>abcde_dat</i>) - otherwise the files would not be
distinguishable.
The linkage of local file names with the names of the permanent
directories and the file name extensions takes place in a
configuration file, which <b>mrun</b> expects to find in
the
respective current working directory of the user. A detailed
description of this configuration file - which still offers a variety
of further functions – is found in the
documentation of the shell script <a href="http://www.muk.uni-hannover.de/-raasch/Software/mrun_beschreibung.html">mrun</a>
(sorry: this is only available in German, so far. If you think that you
would profit from an English version, please give a message to the PALM
group).
In the next chapter a simple example of a minimum configuration file
is described. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">A simple call of <b>mrun</b>
could read
as follows: </p>
<ul> <p style="line-height: 100%;"><tt>mrun -
h <i>ibmh</i> -d <i>abcde</i></tt></p>
</ul><p style="line-height: 100%;">The model is
started by option -<tt>h
<i>ibmh</i></tt> on the IBM Regatta hanni at the
HLRN, i.e. on the
local computer a batch job is generated, transferred to the remote
computer (IBM) and submitted to a suitable queue of the queuing system.
With the
option <tt>-d</tt> the so-called basis file name (<i>abcde</i>)
is
specified, from which, together with the path names and file name
extensions, the complete file names (including the path) of the
permanent input and output files are <font color="#000000">formed.</font><font color="#800000">
</font>Usually the specification of a set of further options is
necessary, e.g. the CPU time needed by the model and the memory size
needed as well as, on parallel computers, the number of processing
elements which are to be used (options <tt>-t</tt>, <tt>-m</tt>
and
<tt>-X</tt>). A precondition for the call of <b>mrun</b>
of course is
that the installation of the model on the local computer and the
remote machine is complete (see <a href="chapter_5.0.html">chapter
5.0</a>). </p>
<p>Beyond these options a variety of further options for model
steering can be used in the call of <b>mrun</b>. These are
fully
described in the <a href="http://www.muk.uni-hannover.de/institut/software/mrun_beschreibung.html">mrun</a>
documentation (in German). <br>
