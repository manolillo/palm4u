Basic techniques of
the LES model and its parallelization </font>
</h2><p style="line-height: 100%;">LES models
generally permit the
simulation of turbulent flows, whereby those eddies, that carry the
main energy are resolved by the numerical grid. Only the
effect of such turbulence elements with diameter equal to or smaller
than the grid spacing are parameterized in the model and
by so-called subgrid-scale (SGS) transport. Larger structures are
simulated directly (they are explicitly resolved) and their effects are
represented by the advection terms. </p>
<p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 100%;">PALM is
based on the
non-hydrostatic incompressible Boussinesq equations. It contains a
water cycle with cloud formation and takes into account infrared
radiative cooling in cloudy conditions. The model has six prognostic
quantities in total &ndash; u,v,w, liquid water potential
temperature
<font face="Thorndale, serif">&Theta;</font><sub>l
</sub>(BETTS,
1973), total water content q and subgrid-scale turbulent kinetic energy
e. The
subgrid-scale turbulence is modeled according to DEARDOFF (1980) and
requires the solution of an additional prognostic equation for the
turbulent kinetic energy e. The long wave radiation scheme is based
on the parametrization of cloud effective emissivity (e.g. Cox, 1976)
and condensation is considered by a simple '0%-or-100%'-scheme, which
assumes that within each grid box the air is either entirely
unsaturated or entirely saturated ( see e.g., CUIJPERS and DUYNKERKE,
1993). The water cycle is closed by using a simplified version of
KESSLERs scheme (KESSLER, 1965; 1969) to parameterize precipitation
processes (M&Uuml;LLER and CHLOND, 1996). Incompressibility is
applied by means of a Poisson equation for pressure, which is solved
with a direct method (SCHUMANN and SWEET, 1988). The Poisson equation
is Fourier transformed in both horizontal directions and the
resulting tridiagonal matrix is solved for the transformed pressure
which is then transformed back. Alternatively, a multigrid method can
also be used. Lateral boundary conditions of the model are cyclic and
MONIN-OBUKHOV similarity is assumed between the surface and the first
computational grid level above. Alternatively, noncyclic boundary
conditions
(Dirichlet/Neumann) can be used along one of the
horizontal directions. At the lower surface, either temperature/
humidity or their respective fluxes can be prescribed. </p>
<p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 100%;">The
advection terms
are treated by the scheme proposed by PIACSEK and WILLIAMS (1970),
which conserves the integral of linear and quadratic quantities up to
very small errors. The advection of scalar quantities can optionally
be performed by the monotone, locally modified version of Botts
advection scheme (CHLOND, 1994). The time integration is performed
with the third-order Runge-Kutta scheme. A second-order Runge-Kutta
scheme, a leapfrog scheme and an Euler scheme are also implemented.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">By default, the time step is
computed
with respect to the different criteria (CFL, diffusion) and adapted
automatically. In case of a non-zero geostrophic
wind the coordinate system can be moved along with the mean wind in
order to maximize the time step (Galilei-Transformation). </p>
<p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 100%;">In
principle a model
run is carried out in the following way: After reading the control
parameters given by the user, all prognostic variables are
initialized. Initial values can be e.g. vertical profiles of the
horizontal wind, calculated using a 1D subset of the 3D prognostic
equation and are set in the 3D-Model as horizontally homogeneous
initial values. Temperature profiles can only be prescribed linear
(with constant gradients, which may change for different vertical
height intervals) and they are assumed in the 1D-Model as stationary.
After the initialization phase during which also different kinds of
disturbances may be imposed to the prognostic fields, the time
integration begins. Here for each individual time step the prognostic
equations are successively solved for the velocity components u, v and
w
as well as for the potential temperature and possibly for the TKE.
After the calculation of the boundary values in accordance with the
given boundary conditions the provisional velocity fields are
corrected with the help of the pressure solver. Following this, all
diagnostic turbulence quantities including possible
Prandtl-layer&ndash;quantities are computed. At the end of a time
step the data output requested by the user is made
(e.g. statistic of analyses for control purposes or profiles and/or
graphics data). If the given end-time was reached, binary data maybe
be saved for restart. </p>
<p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 100%;">The
model is based
on the originally non-parallel LES model which has been operated at the
institute since 1989
and which was parallelized for massively parallel computers with
distributed memory using the Message-Passing-Standard MPI. It is
still applicable on a single processor and also well optimized for
vector machines. The parallelization takes place via a so-called domain
decomposition, which divides the entire model
domain into individual, vertically standing cubes, which extend from
the bottom to the top of the model domain. One processor (processing
element, PE) is assigned to each cube, which
accomplishes the computations on all grid points of the subdomain.
Users can choose between a two- and a one-dimensional domain
decomposition. A 1D-decomposition is preferred on machines with a
slow&nbsp; network interconnection. In case of a 1D-decomposition,
the
grid points along x direction are
distributed among the individual processors, but in y- and z-direction
all respective grid points belong to the same PE. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">The calculation of central
differences or
non-local arithmetic operations (e.g. global
sums, FFT) demands communication and an appropriate data exchange
between the PEs. As a substantial innovation in relation to
the non-parallel model version the individual subdomains are
surrounded by so-called ghost points, which contain the grid point
information of the neighbor processors. The appropriate grid point
values must be exchanged after each change (i.e. in particular after
each time step). For this purpose MPI routines (<tt>MPI_SENDRCV</tt>)
are used. For the solution of the FFT conventional (non-parallelized)
procedures are used. Given that the FFTs are used in x and/or
y-direction, the data which lie distributed on the individual central
processing elements, have to be collected and/or relocated before.
This happens by means of the routine <tt>MPI_ALLTOALLV</tt>.
Certain
global operations like e.g. the search for absolute maxima or minima
within the 3D-arrays likewise require the employment of special MPI
routines (<tt>MPI_ALLREDUCE</tt>). </p>
