example_mountain

1. Purpose
   This example shows the flow around a single 3d idealized 
   mountain. The mountain shape is Gaussian. The inversion height lies
   below the mountain top so that a part of the topography resides in
   stable stratification.

   PALM 3.6 / SVN Revision 244

3. Required user code
   No user code is required.

4. Input: example_mountain_p3d
   Cyclic lateral boundary conditions are used. The 3d-model is initialized with
   the solution of the 1d-model. Rayleigh damping is switched on.

5. Preprocessing
   The topography file has to be prepared according to the topography conventions
   used in PALM. The topography file is created with aid of a 2d Gauss function.
