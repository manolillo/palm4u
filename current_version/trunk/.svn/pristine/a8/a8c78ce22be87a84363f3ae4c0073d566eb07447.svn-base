# palm_simple_install - a script for simple installation and compilation of
#                       the palm code without using mbuild
     # This script creates (from the working copy of the palm repository)
     # a subdirectory MAKE_DEPOSITORY_simple which contains a copy of the
     # palm source code and  a modified makefile which loads required compiler
     # and preprocessor settings via "include MAKE.inc"

     # Options: -i <include file>
     #          one of the include files in ~/palm/current_version/trunk/INSTALL

     # Last changes:
     # 25/01/10 - Siggi - Generating the first version
     # 18/03/10 - Siggi - switch to palm/current_version removed: working
     #                    copy can be in any directory
