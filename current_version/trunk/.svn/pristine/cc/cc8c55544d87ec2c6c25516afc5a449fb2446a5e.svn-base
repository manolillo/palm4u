example_wtm

1. Purpose
   This example shows the application of enhanced actuator disc wind turbine models in PALM 
   The model is based on blade elements and conversion of airfoil lift 
   and drag coefficients from the NREL 5MW reference turbine (see Jonkman et al. 2009:
   Technical Report NREL/TP-500-38060, doi:10.2172/947422) to local forces on the flow.
   The example simulates 4 different turbines in laminar flow that correct their orientation
   after 30s of simulated time by use of a yaw controller.

   PALM 4.0 / SVN Revision 1912

3. Required user code
   No user code is required
   
4. Input: 
   example_wtm_p3d: Cyclic lateral boundary conditions are used. The 3d-model is initialized with
                    constant temperature and constant laminar flow.
   example_wtm_wtm: The property file of the NREL 5MW model turbine has also to be copied to the
                    local INPUT folder, it will be automatically read by PALM

5. Preprocessing
   No preprocessing is required.
   
6. Program start 
   Modifications to .mrun.config: 
   If you don't use the default .mrun.config-files in trunk/SCRIPTS/ you will have to add the
   following lines in your .mrun.config file:
   In "List of input-files":
   WTM_DATA               in:locopt     d3#:d3f  $base_data/$fname/INPUT     _wtm
   In "List of output-files":
   TURBINE_PARAMETERS01   out:loc:tr    d3#:d3f   $base_data/$fname/MONITORING  _turbine_parameters01
   TURBINE_PARAMETERS02   out:loc:tr    d3#:d3f   $base_data/$fname/MONITORING  _turbine_parameters02
   TURBINE_PARAMETERS03   out:loc:tr    d3#:d3f   $base_data/$fname/MONITORING  _turbine_parameters03
   TURBINE_PARAMETERS04   out:loc:tr    d3#:d3f   $base_data/$fname/MONITORING  _turbine_parameters04
   
   mrun call (example for lccrayh):
   mrun -d example_wtm -h lccrayh -K parallel -X 64 -T 24 -t 2000 -q mpp1testq -r "d3# ts# ma#"

7. Monitoring: 
   example_wtm_rc and TURBINE_PARAMETERS01 should be equal to the attached files when run at
   Cray System of HLRN Berlin. For other systems the deviations should be small.

8. Postprocessing
   No postprocessing of the data is required.
