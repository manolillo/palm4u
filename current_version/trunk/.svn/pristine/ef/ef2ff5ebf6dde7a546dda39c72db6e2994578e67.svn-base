Execution of model runs</font></h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">Given that the model was
installed by the user (look at <a href="chapter_5.0.html">chapter
5.0</a>) and that it is clear, which phenomenon is to be
simulated,
there is a whole set of questions which must be answered before
executing
the actual application run, e.g.: </p>
<ul> <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%;">How
large does the model domain have to be and what grid size does
phenomenon to be simulated require? </p> </li> <li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%;">How
long is the time which should be simulated, i.e. which typical time
scale does the phenomenon have? </p> </li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%;">Which
boundary conditions and initial conditions are to be selected? </p>
</li> <li> <p style="font-style: normal; line-height: 100%;">Which model
output data are necessary at which points in time, in order to be able
to analyze the phenomenon afterwards? </p> </li>
</ul><p style="line-height: 100%;">The answers to
these questions
substantially determine the choice of values for the most important
model parameters, with which the model run is steered. All possible
parameters are described in chapters <a href="chapter_4.1.html">4.1</a>,
<a href="chapter_4.2.html">4.2</a>
and <a href="chapter_4.3.html">4.3</a>.
The basic steering of the model with these parameters is explained in
the introduction to <a href="chapter_4.0.html">chapter
4</a>. The user will rarely use all model parameters, since many
are
preset with consistent default values and therefore do not have to be
changed by the user. Some of the most important parameters are not
preset with default values and must be adjusted by the user in each
case. Such a typical, minimum parameter set is described in <a href="chapter_4.4.1.html">chapter
4.4.1</a>. For the subsequent analysis of model runs, graphical
visualization of model data is particularly important. <a href="chapter_4.5.html">Chapter
4.5</a> describes, how such outputs are produced with the model. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">The selected parameters and
their values
have to be supplied to the model as an input file. The
structure of this file is described in the introduction to <a href="chapter_4.0.html">chapter
4</a>. The data, produced by the model, are located in a number
of
different output files. The model works with relative file names
(i.e. without absolute path information). Thus all input and output
files are
expected and put in the directory, in which the actual model (the
executable program created from the FORTRAN source code) is started
(but also see next paragraph).
All user-relevant input and output files are described in <a href="chapter_3.4.html">chapter
3.4</a>. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">The actual model (the
executable
program) is not started directly via the user, but with the help of
the shell script <a href="http://www.muk.uni-hannover.de/institut/software/mrun_beschreibung.html">mrun</a>,which
can be called by the user. This script takes over the entire pre- and
postprocessing work, which is necessary for a model run. In addition
to this, it generates e.g. automatically batch jobs for model runs on
remote computers, provides for the appropriate file transfers of the
input and output files to these computers, secures data on existing
archives systems, starts if necessary restart jobs, and much more.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">mrun</span> allows
to specify
individual path names for each simulation and
for the different types of input/output files. The start of model runs
with <b>mrun</b> is described in <a href="chapter_3.1.html">chapter
3.1</a>. </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">The implementation of user
code
extensions in
the model is made possible by a set of defined interfaces. You will
find references to the programming of such extensions in <a href="chapter_3.5.html">chapter
3.5</a>. Frequently errors arise during the execution of the
model
after such changes, which can often be found only by interactive
model steering and error tracing (debugging), which are described in
<a href="chapter_3.6.html">chapter
3.6</a>. </p>
