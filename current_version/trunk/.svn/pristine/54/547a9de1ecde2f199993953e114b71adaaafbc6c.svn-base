visualization<br>
</h3><p style="line-height: 100%;">PALM is able to
output
data of different quantities as time series,
vertical profiles (usually horizontally averaged), two-dimensional
cross sections or <font color="#000000">3d-volume data.</font>
Depending on the kind of output (time series, profiles, etc.) and the
output format (ASCII&nbsp; or binary) data are written
to different files (file descriptions can be found in
<a href="../app/chapter_3.4.html">chapter
3.4</a>). By default, all data
output files are in NetCDF format (link to the NetCDF documentations in
the Internet and on the PALM homepage), which can be processed by many
public domain and commercial (graphic) software. Data from NetCDF files
can also be easily read from FORTRAN programs provided that a NetCDF
library is available. More detailed informations about the
PALM-NetCDF-output is given in the next subchapter (<a href="../app/chapter_4.5.1.html">4.5.1</a>).</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">Due to historical reasons,
PALM can also
output data in other formats suitable for some special graphic
software. The exact format of these files corresponds to the
requirements of the respective software. Still available at IMUK are <a href="http://www.muk.uni-hannover.de/institut/software/profil_beschreibung.html">profil</a>
(time series, profiles), <a href="http://www.muk.uni-hannover.de/institut/software/iso2d_beschreibung.html">iso2d</a>
(2d cross sections) and <b>AVS</b> (e.g. iso-surfaces of
3d volume
data). The special files created by PALM can be directly used
as input files for these plot programs. Beyond that, <b>profil</b>
and
<b>iso2d</b> need additional information
about the plot layout (e.g. titles, axes labels, arrangement of the
coordinate systems, etc.) provided by so-called parameter files<font color="#800000">.
</font><font color="#000000">Thes</font>e
files are also created by
the PALM, providing a default layout (e.g. plots produced by <b>iso2d</b>
show. only isolines and no color shading). Within certain
limits the plot layout can be steered by some PALM parameters.
Beyond that the user can edit the parameter files created by PALM and
change, supplement or remove the given default values
according to his needs. Beside the file with the (binary) data to be
visualized, <b>AVS</b> additionally needs a file with
coordinate information (likewise binary) and an ASCII file in the
so-called FLD format, which describes the structure of the two binary
files. Coordinate and FLD file are also created by the PALM. However,
with <b>AVS</b> (differently than with <b>profile</b>
or <b>iso2d</b>)
the plot layout must always be additionally designed by the user
with the help of the AVS network editor. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%;">In the following
subchapters, steering
of the different data output and how to create plots of the data is
described by some examples. Not all details of steering
are mentioned. If necessary, these can be found within the
description of the respective parameters.<br>
</p>&nbsp;For most purposes it should be sufficient to read <a href="../app/chapter_4.5.1.html">chapter 4.5.1</a>
which explains the PALM-NetCDF-output.<hr>
